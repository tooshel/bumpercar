= Bumper Car = 


This is to power a kidzone bumpercar I found on the side of the road. The controller was shot so I swapped in an esp32 and an L298N motor driver connected to a 12 Volt Milwakee battery. 

The motor driver stoped driving the motors after I connected an 18 volt battery. On the 12 volt driver, it worked great! Still a WIP but I also didn't want to loose this since it at least has my pin mappings!
