# Bumper Car


This is to power an older KidZone bumpercar I found on the side of the road. The controller was shot so I swapped in an esp32 and an L298N motor driver connected to a 12 Volt Milwakee battery.

The motor driver stoped driving the motors after I connected an 18 volt battery. On the 12 volt driver, it worked great! Still a WIP but I also didn't want to loose this since it at least has my pin mappings! 

If you are intersted I could add a fritzing but truth is I just kept swapping stuff around till it worked. And it'll totally depend on what ESP32 you have! Could also try on on any old Arduino or a Raspberrry Pi Pico.
